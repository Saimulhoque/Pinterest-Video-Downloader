# Pinterest-Video-Downloader
This Python script downloads Pinterest videos by validating and expanding pin URLs, fetching video content, and converting the .m3u8 video link to MP4 format. It uses `requests` to retrieve content and `tqdm` for progress tracking. The downloaded video is saved with a unique timestamp-based filename, ensuring efficient Pinterest video downloads.
